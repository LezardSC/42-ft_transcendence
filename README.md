Transcendence is the final project of the Common Core of 42 school.

# What is Transcendence ?
This project consists in creating a website to take part in a competition of the famous game Pong!

The aim of the project is to immerse students in a project they have no experience of. They have to learn Web development from scratch in order to successfully complete the project.

# Getting Started
- go at the root of the repository.
- type `make prod_up` in the terminal.

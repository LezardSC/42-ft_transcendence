# What is Transcendence ?
This project consists in creating a website to take part in a competition of the famous game Pong!

The aim of the project is to immerse students in a project they have no experience of. They have to learn Web development from scratch in order to successfully complete the project.

They are a mandatory part to this project, and a bunch of modules to choose from to complete it.

You can see read the whole subject [here](en.subject.pdf). There are the modules we chose :

# Getting Started
- go at the root of the repository.
- type `make` in the terminal.
- Go to `https://127.0.0.1:8000` in you browser, or `https://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8000`
- You will need the .env for the project to work correctly.

# Features
- User authentification with e-mail confirmation
- Translations support for English, French and Spanish
- Pong video game
- Online tournaments
- 3d modeling
- Blockchain Implementation
- AI

# Frontend
This using the following stack:
- Language - [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- Styling - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

#### Modules
We implemented a module system, you can read more about it [here](frontend/js/modules/documentation.md)

This makes our code :
- more reusable
- more refactorable
- more categorized
- less prone to errors

#### Translations 
We implemented a library-free translation system, which you can learn about [here](frontend/js/modules/translationsModule/documentation.md)

It is :
- fast
- easy to update
- not very feature rich
- moderately scalable

# Backend
This using the following stack:
- Language - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Framework - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- Database - [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  
### 42 Authentification
You can create an account and login using a password-free authentification with your 42 account.
I will retrieve your school's profile picture, username and email.

# Blockchain
Each time a tournament is completed, the result of each match in the tournament is sent to the blockchain.
When the transaction is complete, the "see on blockchain" button appears, allowing you to view the transaction directly and check the information (click on 'show more' then 'View input as UTF-8').

The display is difficult to read, but the order is always: "tournament name, tournament winner's name, then each match in the following order: 'player 1, player 1's score, player 2, player 2's score, match winner's name'".

# AI
An AI agent is implemented in the game using a deep neural network.
The AI is trained during games between two human players so it can reach competitive levels of play.

Core Features:
- AI plays Pong using supervised learning.
- Trained using TensorFlow and a deep neural network.
- Adjustable difficulty levels or training parameters.

Technologies used : 
- Building and training the neural network - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=fr)
- Language - [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- Data manipulation and preprocessing - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
